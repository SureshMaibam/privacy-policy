Privacy Policy for Elementa

Last updated: January 2026

Elementa (“the app”) is an educational application designed to provide information related to chemical elements. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the app.

Information Collection and Use

Elementa does not require users to create an account, and we do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or precise location data.

The app can be used anonymously.

Advertising

Elementa displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob.

AdMob may collect certain non-personal information automatically, including but not limited to:

Device information (such as device type and operating system)

Advertising ID

Approximate location (country or region)

Interaction data with ads

This information is used by AdMob to serve relevant and non-intrusive advertisements and to measure ad performance.

The app developer does not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.

Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Elementa itself does not use cookies or tracking technologies.

However, third-party advertising services like AdMob may use cookies or similar technologies as part of their ad delivery process.

Children’s Privacy

Elementa is intended for general educational use and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

Since no user accounts or personal data collection exist within the app, there is no risk of intentional data capture from children.

Data Security

As Elementa does not collect or store personal user data, there is no user data retained on servers or databases by the app developer.

Third-party services such as AdMob manage their own security practices independently.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
